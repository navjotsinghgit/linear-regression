# There are four files(Juypter Notebooks)
first one is lab 1 in which there is the basic introduction about the about the juypter notebook which is optional.
second one is lab 2 which is based on the simple mathematical model we can make to compute the predicition based on the data provided in the repo named as (deeplearning.mlpstyle)
third one is lab 3 based on the cost function which is the solution of the loss which model is being through in the 2 lab .
fourth one is lab 4 based on the gradient decent algorithm which based on the multiple weights.
